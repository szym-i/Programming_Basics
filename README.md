My solutions to Programming Basics course in AGH UST \
Laboratory classes lecturer : **Stanisław Polak** \
Each laboratory, I could get six points, four from home tasks, and two which I could gain during classes (1,5 h). \
My results:
lab 2 | lab 3| lab 4 | lab 5 | lab 6
:----:| :---:| :----:|:-----:|:-----:
4+1,5 | 4+1  | 4     | 4+1   | 4+1,8 



Compile codes in Linux Terminal with: **gcc prog.c -o prog** or **gcc prog.c -lm -o prog** (for those with <math.h> module)
